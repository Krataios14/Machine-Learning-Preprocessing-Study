# Machine-Learning-Preprocessing-Study
This pipeline is an attempt at improving the data value and decreasing the value loss of a standard LSTM model, by extracting the Fourier features and studying the features of  several financial indexes.
Using a brownian simulation to build several LSTM models, this project will try to build the optimal solution that leverages a large number of LSTMs rather than a single LSTM model to specialise them in different data progression formats.
